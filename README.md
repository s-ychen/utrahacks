Wound dressing and bandages/casts speed up the time of recovery by around 30-70% it is easy to use, cost-effective, and extremely accessible. Bandages and dressings create a moist, clean, warm environment free of outside infections and optimize healing.

The issue: 
Reapplication of the ointment is proven to speed up healing time, but the bandage/cast must be taken off to re-applicate the dressing, exposing the wound to potential contamination. When wound temperature decreases by as little as 2â„ƒ, healing will begin to slow down or even cease, and is inconvenient for the patient possibly requiring a healthcare professional to re-do bandage or cast. 

What it does:
Detects the temperature of the skin surrounding your wound directly inside the bandage and reapplies dressing as the dressing is used up in the healing process.
